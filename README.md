## Single cell analysis of the generation and regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells


**Summary:** The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neurogenic niche in the adult forebrain. Notably, neural stem cells (NSCs) of the SVZ generate not only neurons, but also oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system. Transcriptomic studies have provided detailed knowledge of the molecular events that regulate neurogenesis, but little is understood about adult oligodendrogenesis from SVZ NSCs.

To address this, an in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analyses was done to resolve the major differences in neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages derived from the adult SVZ. A hallmark of adult oligodendrogenesis was the stage-specific expression of transcriptional modulators that regulate developmental oligodendrogenesis. Notably, divergence of the oligodendroglial lineage is distinguished by Wnt-Notch and angiogenesis-related signalling, whereas G-protein-coupled receptor signalling pathways were the major signature observed in the neurogenic lineage.

Moreover, in-depth gene regulatory network analysis identified key stage-specific master regulators of the oligodendrocyte lineage and revealed new mechanisms by which signalling pathways interact with transcriptional networks to control lineage progression. This study was able to connect in a multilevel network 13 distinct phases of differentiation from NSCs to mature oligodendrocytes by including novel transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating the transition of stages.

## Dissecting the oligodendrocyte lineage heterogeneity: Framework for in-depth examination into disease states
The SVZ has been recently described as heterogeneous germinal zone that contains NSCs that continuously gives rise to new neural cells life-long. This heterogeneous germinal zone has been identified from the labs of Raineteau, Berninger, Gotz, Parras, Butt, Richardson and others (Kessaris et al., 2006; Young et al., 2007; Brill et al., 2009; Winpenny et al., 2011; Nakatani et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2013; Fiorelli et al., 2015; Azim et al., 2017; Zweifel et al., 2018), demonstrating that it consists of distinct SVZ microdomain that generates different neural lineages throughout life. For example, the NSCs from the dorsal wall (cells in red in Figure above) preferably differentiate into glutamatergic neurons or oligodendrocytes, whilst NSCs from more ventral regions gives rise interneurons. The functions of these newly generated cells are for plasticity purposes, maintenance and re-organization of neuronal networks. Subclasses of newborn neurons migrate long distance and invade the olfactory bulb.

Neural cell genesis occurs sequentially, and the last cells to be generated in the SVZ are oligodendrocytes (Rowitch and Kriegstein, 2010; Naruse et al., 2017). As shown above, dorsal NSCs preferentially generate oligodendrocytes whereas interneurons are derived from more ventral NSCs. These findings in the field led to the concept that regionally segregated NSCs are primed in a time-controlled manner for the generation of neural subtypes, proposing that intrinsic mechanisms coupled to environmental cues drive NSC fates into specific neuronal and glial lineages. In the postnatal and adult SVZ, dorsalizing cues include the liver X receptor, FGF2 and Wnt signalling pathways (reviewed in (Azim et al., 2016)), whereas Shh regulates the expression of more ventralising transcriptional networks (Ihrie et al., 2011). This suggests that signalling pathways coordinate transcriptional networks, and are aspects that can be functionally probed for driving cell fates or lineage reprogramming. 


The transcriptional networks controlling SVZ-NSCs during adult oligodendrogenesis are currently unsolved. In this project, we set out to unravel the molecular mechanisms orchestrating the fate of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Here, we used a strategy developed by Dr Onur Basak and colleagues where NSCs/progenitors and subtypes of neural cells surrounding the niche of young adult SVZ were isolated and FACS-enriched using genetic reporters and immunochemical markers as described in detail for olfactory neurogenesis in his landmark study (Basak et al., 2018).
