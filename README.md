## Single cell analysis of the generation and regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells


The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neurogenic niche in the adult forebrain. Notably, neural stem cells (NSCs) of the SVZ generate not only neurons, but also oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system. Transcriptomic studies have provided detailed knowledge of the molecular events that regulate neurogenesis, but little is understood about adult oligodendrogenesis from SVZ NSCs.

To address this, an in-depth single-cell transcriptomic analyses was done to resolve the major differences in neuronal and oligodendroglial lineages derived from the adult SVZ. A hallmark of adult oligodendrogenesis was the stage-specific expression of transcriptional modulators that regulate developmental oligodendrogenesis. Notably, divergence of the oligodendroglial lineage is distinguished by Wnt-Notch and angiogenesis-related signalling, whereas G-protein-coupled receptor signalling pathways were the major signature observed in the neurogenic lineage.

Moreover, in-depth gene regulatory network analysis identified key stage-specific master regulators of the oligodendrocyte lineage and revealed new mechanisms by which signalling pathways interact with transcriptional networks to control lineage progression. This study was able to connect in a multilevel network 13 distinct phases of differentiation from NSCs to mature oligodendrocytes by including novel transcriptional mechanisms orchestrating the transition of stages.
