This file:
The entire matrix of 1007 cells normalised of Neuro clones + MOLs-2.csv

Has to be filtered to only contains genes enriched in neuro clones+NBs+MOLs. 
Then its ready as an x matrix (2-3K genes)
Then, the top 10 of each cluster, should be 75-80 genes or so...should be filtered so it becomes the v matrix. 

The cluster names and numbers have to be identified also.
